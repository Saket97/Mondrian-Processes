# Mondrian Processes
Mondrian Processes is a guillotine-partition based stochastic process that possesses an elegant self-consistency property. These properties of Mondrian Processes allowes it to be used in various areas of machine learning. This repository contains the implementation of an SVM classifier which uses Mondrian Processes as an approximation for the computationally expensive Laplace kernel.
