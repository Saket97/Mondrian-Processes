# Report
Firstly we studied some basic concepts of probability-
			1) Probability as a set function
			2) Conditional probability and Independence
			3) Random Variables
			4) Probability Density functions
			5) Probability Mass function
			6) Transformation
			7) Expectation
			8) Moment Generating function

Next, we studied Poisson's and Exponential Distributions followed by Mondrian Process.

Our next plan is to start implementing Mondrian Process and then analyze the random features of laplacian Kernels.
